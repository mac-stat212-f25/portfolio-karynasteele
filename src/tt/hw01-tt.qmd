## Research Question
### On average, which countries produce chess players with the highest ratings?

*only keeping countries with more than 2500 players*

```{r}
fide_ratings_september1 <- fide_ratings_september %>%
  group_by(fed) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 2500)
```

```{r}
ggplot(fide_ratings_september1, aes(x = fed, y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") + 
  theme_classic()
```
```{r, fig.alt="Horizontal bar chart showing average chess ratings by federation for countries with more than 2500 players. Bars are colored with a gradient from light blue to dark blue based on rating."}
fide_ratings_september1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(fed, avg_rating), y = avg_rating, fill = avg_rating)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Which Federations Have the Highest Average Chess Ratings?",
       subtitle = "Countries with >2500 players (FIDE September ratings)",
       x = "Federation", y = "Average Rating",
       caption = "Author: Karyna Steele | Date: September 2025 | Source: FIDE Player Database") +
  theme_classic()
```
